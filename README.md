In this project you can track any IP details .here i have used some technologies and api's to archive this project successfull work.



> - HTML
> - CSS
> - JAVASCRIPT
> - LEAFLET API
> - IPIFY API
> - NETLIFY

Here i have used [leaflet](https://leafletjs.com/examples/quick-start/) api to show the realtime map on my website , and to display the ip related infomation i used [ipify api](https://geo.ipify.org/). 
To host the whole project and visible to the whole world i was hosted it on netlify ,which is a rapid hosting provider.
